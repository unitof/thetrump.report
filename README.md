# thetrump.report

## Donald Trump’s current approval rating, and nothing else.

Data [pulled](//realclearpolitics.com/epolls/json/5493_historical.js?callback=return_json) on each refresh from RealClearPolitics.

Percent shown is percent favorable. See console for unfavorable. RCP’s score averages a [bunch](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html) of sources via dark magic & algorithms.

Rendered with the most basic d3 you done ever seen.

And get this: global JS variables. Get over it.

Someday I’ll make a favicon.

## Deployment

Thanks to [Now](https://zeit.co/now) for deploys like git pushes. Boy I wish I had Now in high school and servers were scary and everything broke always.
